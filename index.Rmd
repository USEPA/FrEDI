This repository is for FrEDI, the **Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts**, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

FrEDI is an open-source, reduced form model that rapidly projects the impacts of climate change within the United States, under any custom temperature or policy pathway. 

FrEDI was developed to fill an important gap in assessing U.S. climate change impacts by incorporating a broad range of impact studies into a common, open-source framework. This allows FrEDI to facilitate comparability across impact studies, with the flexibility of facilitating custom scenario analyses. 

FrEDI is continually developed and currently draws upon over 30 existing peer-reviewed studies, including from the [Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA)](https://www.epa.gov/cira/) project, to estimate the relationship between future degrees of warming and impacts across more than 20 category sectors, 48 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia, and population groups. When supplied with a user-defined temperature trajectory, FrEDI then applies these temperature-impact relationships to rapidly project annual climate change impacts and damages through the end of the 21st century (optionally through the year 2300).
